For Part B you're going to be implementing three different versions of
a priority queue:

0) Unordered (2 versions, completed for you; useful for understanding 1-3)
1) Sorted
2) Binary heap
3) Pairing heap

You ARE given templated starter files for these.  Start reading about
the Pairing heap, and start thinking about implementation.  You will
need to use the "left child, right sibling" approach, NOT a vector or
deque of child pointers.
