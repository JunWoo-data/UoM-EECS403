EECS281 Advanced Makefile Help
* This Makefile uses advanced techniques, for more information:
    $$ man make

* General usage
    1. Follow directions at each "TODO" in this file.
       a. Set EXECUTABLE equal to the name from the project specification.
       b. Set PROJECTFILE equal to the name of the source file with main()
       c. Add any dependency rules specific to your files.
    2. Build, test, submit... repeat as necessary.

* Preparing submissions
    A) To build 'partialsubmit.tar.gz', a tarball without tests used to
       find buggy solutions in the autograder.

           *** USE THIS ONLY FOR TESTING YOUR SOLUTION! ***

       This is useful for faster autograder runs during development and
       free submissions if the project does not build.
           $$ make partialsubmit
    B) Build 'fullsubmit.tar.gz' a tarball complete with autograder test
       files.

           *** ALWAYS USE THIS FOR FINAL GRADING! ***

       It is also useful when trying to find buggy solutions in the
       autograder.
           $$ make fullsubmit

* Unit testing support
    A) Source files for unit testing should be named test*.cpp.  Examples
       include test_input.cpp or test3.cpp.
    B) Automatic build rules are generated to support the following:
           $$ make test_input
           $$ make test3
           $$ make alltests        (this builds all test drivers)
    C) If test drivers need special dependencies, they must be added
       manually.
    D) IMPORTANT: NO SOURCE FILES WITH NAMES THAT BEGIN WITH test WILL BE
       ADDED TO ANY SUBMISSION TARBALLS.

* Static Analysis support
    A) Matches current autograder style grading tests
    B) Usage:
           $$ make static

* Sync to CAEN support
    A) Requires an .ssh/config file with a login.engin.umich.edu host
       defined, SSH Multiplexing enabled, and an open SSH connection.
    B) Edit the REMOTE_BASEDIR variable if default is not preferred.
    C) Usage:
           $$ make sync2caen
